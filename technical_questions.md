# Technical questions

Discrepancies and open questions to resolve with FluidTokens (upstream
`ft-bifrost-bridge`). Mirrored in
`internal-docs/bitfrost/heimdall/spec_differences.md`.

## 1. Registration linked-list: node key in datum (spec) vs NFT asset name (code)

`documentation/technical_documentation.md` §3.2 "Registration Linked-List"
(added 2026-03-03) sketches the node **datum** as carrying the ordering key:

```json
{ key              :: ByteArray        -- pool_id (ordering key)
, next             :: ByteArray | Null -- key of the next node, or null for the tail
, data             ::
    { bifrost_id_pk :: ByteArray
    , bifrost_url   :: ByteArray
    }
}
```

The implemented contracts (`onchain/validators/bitcoin/spos-registry.ak` +
`aiken_design_patterns/linked_list`, merged 2026-04-20 in M2 PR #15, confirmed
against the compiled `plutus.json` blueprint) store **no key in the datum**.
The element's key is the asset name of the registry-policy NFT held in the
UTxO (`"reg-root"` for the root, `pool_id` for nodes, empty node-key prefix),
and the datum is only:

```text
Element       = Constr(0, [ ElementData, Link ])
ElementData   = Constr(0, [ Constr(0, []) ])                            -- Root{ListRootData}
              | Constr(1, [ Constr(0, [bifrost_id_pk, bifrost_url]) ])  -- Node{RegistrationNodeData}
Link          = Constr(0, [ next_key ]) | Constr(1, [])                 -- Some key / None
```

The difference is not cosmetic. A datum is unauthenticated, mutable state:
anyone can park a UTxO at the script address with a forged `key`, and every
spend path would have to re-check "key unchanged" and "key == token name".
The asset name is minted under the registry policy (validated once, at mint),
immutable without a burn/mint the policy controls, and indexable by chain
indexers (`(policy, pool_id)` lookup). The implemented design is the stronger
one; the spec sketch describes the *logical* record, not the wire format.

Anything decoding registration datums from the spec sketch instead of the
contracts would mis-parse every element. Heimdall follows the contracts
(`src/cardano/registry.rs`, WI-002).

Related naming drift in the same section: §3.2 says the operations correspond
to `ordered.prepend` / `ordered.remove`; the implementation uses
`linked_list.insert_ascending` / `linked_list.remove`.

**Question for FluidTokens:** update §3.2 to the implemented shape (key as
NFT asset name, `Element{data, link}` datum), or is a datum-key redesign
intended? Until answered, the spec/code mismatch is tracked as a heimdall
work item blocking register_spo tx construction (WI-005).

**Resolved (2026-06-11): spec-ward.** The code is canonical; the spec was
patched to match. `technical_documentation.md` §3.2 (registration) and §3.4
(ban — same `linked_list.Element` shape, same error) now describe the key as
the NFT asset name and the datum as `Element{data, link}`, with the operation
names (`linked_list.insert_ascending`/`remove`) and module reference
corrected. ft-bifrost-bridge commit `4bcc70e` (fork
`feat/b1-confirm-tm-reference`). WI-008 closed; WI-005 unblocked.

## 2. Peg-out amount: gross vs net, and where the TM fee parameters live

Two related issues found while wiring the Treasury Movement peg-out payments
(heimdall `src/cardano/pegout_datum.rs` + `src/bitcoin/tm_builder.rs`).

### 2a. The spec contradicts itself on the peg-out output amount

- The **peg-out request** sections say the destination is paid the *full*
  locked amount: §"Peg-out (Bitcoin)" — "The peg-out **amount** is simply the
  fBTC quantity held in the UTxO's value"; the Treasury Movement **outputs**
  row — "one payment output per PegOut (pays `btc_destination_scriptPubKey`
  with `amount`)"; and "Each PegOut payment matches the destination **and
  amount in its datum**."
- The **Treasury Movement → "Amounts and fees"** subsection says the opposite:
  "Per-peg-out protocol fee: a fixed fee (protocol parameter) deducted from
  each peg-out output… Each peg-out output: amount from the PegOut UTxO datum
  **minus** the per-peg-out protocol fee."

The reconciliation is almost certainly: the datum amount is the GROSS the user
burns, and the BTC output pays gross − fee (the "Amounts and fees" subsection
is authoritative; the earlier "pays `amount`" is a simplification). On-chain,
`peg-out.ak` binds `redeemer_peg_out_amount == bridged_tokens_to_peg_out` (the
gross), and delegates the actual BTC-output-value check to
`legit_treasury_movement_and_peg_out_produced_verifier` — which is **named in
`ConfigDatum` but not yet implemented**, so whether that verifier will require
`output == gross` or `output == gross − fee` is currently undefined by code.
heimdall follows the "Amounts and fees" model (gross − fee). **Question:**
confirm the gross-minus-fee model and fix the earlier sections to match.

### 2b. The implemented `ConfigDatum` has no fee fields

The spec says `fee_rate_sat_per_vb` is "a protocol parameter stored in the
Config UTxO on Cardano, updated by governance," and the per-peg-out fee is "a
fixed fee (protocol parameter)." But the implemented
`onchain/lib/bifrost/types/config.ak` `ConfigDatum` carries no fee fields at
all (policy ids, verifier script hashes, `min_stake` only). So there is
nowhere on-chain for SPOs to read the agreed fee parameters from.

This matters for FROST determinism: the TM bytes (peg-out outputs + treasury
change) depend on BOTH `fee_rate_sat_per_vb` and the per-peg-out fee, and the
spec's "deterministic since all SPOs build the same transaction" only holds if
every SPO uses identical values. heimdall currently reads both from LOCAL
per-operator config (`bitcoin.fee_rate_sat_per_vb`,
`bitcoin.per_pegout_fee_sat`), which diverges across operators. **Question:**
add `fee_rate_sat_per_vb` (and the per-peg-out fee) to `ConfigDatum` so SPOs
read consensus values, or specify another agreed source? Tracked as a heimdall
work item (source TM fee params from the on-chain Config UTxO) that gates real
multi-SPO TM signing.

### 2c. The Config UTxO is undocumented in the spec, and immutable in code

The `config.ak` Config UTxO is the central protocol-parameter oracle in the
implementation — `peg_in.ak` / `peg_out.ak` are parameterized by
`config_nft_policy_id` + `config_nft_asset_name` and read `ConfigDatum` as a
reference input at runtime (verifier script hashes, token policies, `min_stake`).
Yet in the spec:

- `config.ak` / the Config UTxO is **absent from the on-chain components list**
  (which enumerates `spos_registry`, `spo_bans`, `fault_verifier`, `peg_in`,
  `peg_out`, `treasury`, `treasury_movement`, `bridged_asset`). The Config UTxO
  is mentioned exactly **once** in the whole document (the `fee_rate_sat_per_vb`
  line above), with no datum/field/governance description.
- That single mention is wrong on two counts vs the code: (i) `ConfigDatum`
  has no fee field (see 2b); (ii) it says "updated by governance," but
  `config.ak`'s `spend` branch is `False` — the Config UTxO is **immutable**
  once minted and can never be updated by anyone.

So "read the fee from the governance-updated Config UTxO" is **not
implementable against the current contracts**: the field isn't there and the
UTxO can't be updated.

### Resolution direction (decided 2026-06-11): fix CONTRACTS to the spec

Unlike §1 (registration linked-list, where the code is the newer deliberate
artifact and the **spec** is canonical — resolve spec-ward), §2 resolves
**code-ward: the spec's design (a governance-updatable Config UTxO holding the
fee parameters) is canonical, and the contracts are to be brought into
compliance.** Each `spec_differences` entry names its own canonical side so the
two are not later "fixed" in the wrong direction.

These are FluidTokens **upstream** contracts (`ft-bifrost-bridge`); heimdall
cannot change them unilaterally, so a-d below are a change request to / upstream
contribution for FluidTokens, and the spec itself must be elaborated in tandem
(it is currently incomplete and self-contradictory, per 2a-2c). Concrete work
this decision implies:

- **(a) Spec** — document the Config UTxO + `ConfigDatum` field list; add
  `fee_rate_sat_per_vb` + the per-peg-out fee; define the governance update
  mechanism; resolve gross-vs-net (2a); state the per-peg-out fee value and
  whether fees are exact or leader-bounded (see the signing-model note below).
- **(b) Contract** — add the fee fields **and a minimum peg-out fBTC value** to
  `ConfigDatum` (`lib/bifrost/types/config.ak`); see 2d.
- **(c) Contract** — change `config.ak` `spend` from `False` to a
  governance-authorized update path so the Config UTxO is actually updatable.
- **(d) Contract** — implement the
  `legit_treasury_movement_and_peg_out_produced` verifier (today unimplemented)
  to check the BTC output value == gross − fee. This is also the missing piece
  that makes the whole peg-out completion path currently unverifiable.
- **(e) heimdall** — read the fee params from the Config UTxO reference input;
  drop local `bitcoin.*fee*` as the source of truth (keep only as a dev
  override). This is WI-009, gated on (a)-(d).

Dependency: (a) → (b,c,d) → (e).

**Signing-model sub-question (open).** Whether the fee must be an *exact*
consensus value or a governance-set *bound* depends on the FROST signing model:
(A) every SPO independently reconstructs the identical tx (exact value
required), vs (B) a leader proposes the tx and each signer validates-then-signs
(a bound suffices, and signers must NEVER blind-sign — they validate inputs,
peg-out destinations/amounts at gross − fee, treasury next-address, and that
the fee is within bounds). (B) handles real-time Bitcoin fee movement better. A
governance-updatable Config UTxO (c) supports either. To be decided with the
spec elaboration (a).

### 2d. Minimum peg-out fBTC value belongs in the Config (not just off-chain skip)

A peg-out whose locked fBTC is below `per_peg_out_fee + Bitcoin dust (330 sat)`
is **physically unfulfillable** — no valid BTC output can be produced — so the
TM builder must drop it. heimdall now does this defensively off-chain
(`build_tm` skips such peg-outs and reports them in `UnsignedTm.skipped_pegouts`
instead of aborting the whole TM; without it, anyone could park 1 sat of fBTC at
the permissionlessly-payable `peg_out.ak` address and DoS every Treasury
Movement bridge-wide). But the off-chain skip is a liveness band-aid: it leaves
the unfulfillable PegOut UTxO on-chain (the user must Cancel to reclaim), and
the skip threshold is only deterministic across SPOs if `per_peg_out_fee` is a
consensus value (2b).

The proper fix is on-chain: **add a `min_peg_out_fbtc` value to `ConfigDatum`
and have `peg_out.ak` reject a lock whose fBTC value is below it.** Then
sub-dust peg-outs cannot be created in the first place, the griefing vector is
closed at the source, and the off-chain skip becomes a belt-and-suspenders
guard rather than the only defense. The minimum must be ≥ `per_peg_out_fee +
dust` (and realistically higher, since the spec already positions Bifrost for
large liquidity moves, not retail-size withdrawals). **Question for
FluidTokens:** add `min_peg_out_fbtc` to the Config and enforce it in
`peg_out.ak` at lock time — folded into the §2 code-ward contract changes (b).
